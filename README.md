## FAQ

### How to install Sass via Command Line using NPM

- If you use Node.js, you can install Sass using npm by running

`npm install -g sass`

- If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by runnin

`choco install sass`

- Install on Mac OS X or Linux (Homebrew)

  If you use the Homebrew package manager for Mac OS X or Linux, you can install Dart Sass by running

`brew install sass/sass/sass`

For more information about the instalation process or others way to install and/or use it, please check their [website](https://sass-lang.com/install).

### How to compile one particular file

You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to.
For example, running:

`sass input.scss output.css`

Tells sass to take a single Sass file, `input.scs`, and compile that file to `output.css`.

### How to watch for changes in individual files

You can also watch individual files or directories with the **--watch** flag.
The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile
CSS each time you save your Sass.

You'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:

`sass --watch input.scss output.css`

### How to watch for changes in multiple files without re-compiling

You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and
output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:

`sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets`

Sass would watch all files in the **app/sass** folder for changes, and compile CSS
to the **public/stylesheets** folder.

## Future optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility
